to write any java code boilerplate is required 

public class and main function

public class 01 {
    public static void main (string args[]){
        
    }
}

OUTPUT IN JAVA

System.out.print("Hello World");

Java is a compiled language
Java is a static typed language

VARIABLES

a = 10 , b = 9 

2 , 3 -> literals

a, b, print , int , -> Identifiers 


DATA TYPES

Primitive 

byte - 1 byte
short - 2 bytes 
char - 2 bytes 
boolean - 1 byte 
int - 4 bytes 
long - 8 bytes 
float - 4 bytes 
double - 8 bytes 

Non-Primitive

String 
Array
Class 
Object 
Interface

there are different types of data types because of the memory they use to store the data

COMMENTS IN JAVA 

// -> simgle line 
/*  . . .  */ -> Multi line 

INPUTS IN JAVA 

next 
nextLine
nextInt
nextByte
nextFloat
nextDouble
nextBoolean
nextShort
nextLong

TYPE CONVERSION (widening and implicit conversion)

canversion can happen when :
a. type compatible 
b. Destination type > source type  -> lossy conversion 


byte -> short -> int -> float -> long -> double

TYPE CASTING (explicit conversion)

int marks = (int)(99.99f)

TYPE PROMOTION IN EXPRESSIONS

1. Java automatically promotes each byte, short or char oprand to int when evaluating an expression.
2. If one oprand is long, float or double the whole expression is promoted to long. float, or double respectively.

HOW DOES THE JAVA CODE RUNS 

JDK contains the development tools and the JRE (Java runtime enviornment)
the JRE contains the JVM (java virtual machine) and the libraries

COMPILATION [source code (.java) -> compiler -> byte code (.class)]  EXECUTION [-> JVM -> Native code] (the native code is different fore different OS)
Java is a portable language but C++ is not a portable language
